## Part I: Lessons from Top Tech Companies

> it doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build

### Chapter 1: Behind Every Great Product

> It is my strong belief that behind every great product there is someone -- usually someone behind the scenes, working tirelessly -- who led the product team to combine technology and design to solve real customer problems in a way that met the needs of the business

### Chapter 3: Startups -- Getting to Product/Market Fit

- three stages of companies: `startups`, `growth-stage companies`, and `enterprises`
- startups are:
  - new product copmany that has yet to achieve product/market fit
  - trying to come up with a product that can power a viable business
  - race to achieve product/market fit before you run out of money

### Chapter 7: Beyond Lean and Agile

The best product teams have 3 overarching principles at work:

1. Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end
2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially
3. Finally, it's all bout solving problems, not implementing features

### Chapter 8: Key Concepts

- Holistic definition of product includes:
  - functionality -- aka features
  - technology that enables functionality
  - how to monetize the functionality
  - delivering offline experiences could be essential to delivering the product's value
- we need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to market
- always working in parallel to both discover the necessary product to be built while the engineers work to deliver a production-quality product
  - engineers are part of discovery and product folks help in delivery
- **product discovery** is about the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering
  - we tackle the various risks before we write a line of production software
  - output of discovery is a *validated product backlog*; we answer 4 critial questions:
    - Will the user buy this? Will the user choose to use it?
    - Can the user figure out how to use this?
    - Can our engineers build this?
    - Can stakeholders support this?
- **prototypes** allow us to run a series of very quick experiments during discovery
  - these are quick and inexpensive... hence prototype
  - we want to come up with something that provides some evidence it is worth building and that we can then deliver to our customers
  - **minimal viable product** is a prototype that can be used to prove an idea
- **product delivery** is about building and deliverying production-quality technology products
- **product vision** is a longer term objective of the product
  - how the product organization intends to deliver on the company's mission

#### Product/Market Fit

> smallest possible actual product that meets the needs of a specific market of custoemrs

Wikipedia: [Product/Market Fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit)

- discovery activities help us determine the necessary product, but it is delivery that a ctually does the work necessary to build, test, and release the product

## Part II: The Right People

### Chapter 9: Principles of Strong Product Teams

- **product team** is a group of people who bring together different specialized skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a product or at least a substantial piece of a larger product
- you want a team of missionariese versus mercenaries
  - mercenaries build whatever they're told to build
  - missionaries are for true believer in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their custoemrs
- the team is there to solve hard problems for the business
  - they are given clear objectives and they are delivering on those objectives
  - they are empowered to figure out the best way to meet those objectives; they are accountable for their results
- teams are intentionally flat; everybody is an individual contributor
- product, design, and engineering work out solutions together
- it's important that a product team has responsibility for all the work -- all the projects, features, bug fixes, performance work, optimizations, and content changes
  - everything and anything for their product
- try to keep teams together and fairly stable
  - members of the team get to know one another and learn how to work well together
  - experience helps in creating innovation
- teams should be autonomous -- we try to minimize dependencies between teams
- collaboration is built on relationships and product teams are designed to nurture those relationships
- the product team needs to understand the business objectives and context
  - full team feels ownership and responsibility of outcome
  - they are not off the hook because somethin glaunches; they don't rest until it's working for users and for the business

### Chapter 10: The Product Manager

Three essential ways for a Product Manager to work:
1. The product manager can escale every issue and decision up to the CEO; they are a backlog administrator
2. The product manager can call a meeting with all the stakeholders in the room and let them fight it out; they are a roadmap administrator
3. The product manager can do his or her job

- product managers need to be among the strongest talent in the company
- responsible for evaluating opportunities and determining what gets built and delivered to customers

> Every business depends on customers. And what custoemrs buy -- or choose to use -- is your product. The product is the result of what the product team builds, and the product manager is responsible for what the product team will build.

- become an acknowledged expert on the customer: their issues, pains, desires, and how they think
  - for business products: how they work and how they decide to buy
- understand what the customer is doing with your product
- deep understanding of your business and how it works
  - know various stakeholders and the constraints they operate under
  - success means convincing each key stakeholder that you understand their constraints and that you are committed to only delivering solutions that you believe are consist with those constraints
- deep knowledge of the market and industry in which you're competing
  - competitors, key trends in technology, customer behaviors and expectations, following relevant industry analysts, and understanding the role of social media for your market and customers
  - you need to be *substantially better* to motivate a user or customer to switch
- the successful product manager must be the very best versions of smart, creative, and persistent
  - smart: intellectually curious, quickly learning and appying new technologies to solve problems for customers, to reach new audiences, or to enable new business models
  - creative: thinking out of the normal product box of features to solve business problems
  - persistent: pushing companies way beyond their comfort zone with compelling evidence, constant communication, and building bridges across functions in the face of stubborn resistance
- product managers should be product owners; they need to own the backlog

#### How to Prepare

- Start becoming an expert in your users and customers. Share very openly what you learn, both the good and the bad. Become your team's and your company's go-to person for understanding anything about your customer -- quantitative and qualitative
- Work to establish a strong relationship wih your key stakeholders and business partners. Convince them of two things: (1) You understand the constraints they operate under. (2) You will only bring to them solutions that you believe will work within those constraints
- Become an undisputed expert on your product and your industry. Again, share your knowledge openly and generously.
- Finally, work very hard to build and nurture the strong collaborative relationship with your product team.

### Chapter 11: The Product Designer

- responsible for
  - product discovery
  - holistic user experience design
    - UX is anyway the customer and end users realize the value provided by your product
    - think about the customer's journey over time as they interact with the product and with the company as a whole
  - prototyping
  - user testing
    - build testing into their weekly cadence so they're able to constantly validate and refine ideas as well as collect new insights they might not have been looking for

#### Keys to a Successful and Health Relationship with Your Designer

1. Do whatever you need to do to have your designer sit next to you.
1. Include your designer from the ery inception of every idea.
1. Include your designer in as many customer and user interactions as possible. Learn about the users and customers together.
1. Fight your temptation to provide your designer with your own design ideas. Give your designer as much room as possible to solve the design challenges him or herself.
1. Encourage your designer to iterate early and often. The best way you can encourage this is to not get all nitpicky about design details with the very early iterations. More generally, encourage your designer to feel free not to just iterate on the particular design approach but to explore alternative solutions to the problem.

### Chapter 12: The Engineers

- Product Managers must share openly what they know about customers, their painpoints, data, and business contraints
  - job is to bring information to your team and then discuss the various potential solutions to these problems
- constantly demonstrate to your team that you're open minded, you know how to listen, and you want and need their help in coming up with the right product
- need to engage directly with your engineers every workday
- give engineers latitude in coming up with the best possible solution
- good to involve engineers in customer pain you are trying to solve and the business problem you face
  - they will respect you and rise to the challenge

### Chapter 20: Principles of Structuring Product Teams

1. Alignment with investment strategy
1 Minimize Dependencies
1. Ownership and Autonomy
1. Maximize Leverage
1. Product Vision and Strategy
1. Team Size
1. Alignment with Architecture
1. Alignment with user or Customer
1. Alignment with Business
1. Structure is a Moving Target

## Part III: The Right Product

### Product Roadmaps

- prioritized list of features and projects your team has been asked to work on
- management has fair reasons for wanting product roadmaps:
  - want to be sure you're working on the highest-value thing first
  - trying to run a business which means they need to be able to plan
    - they want to know when key capabilities will launch so they can coordinate marketing programs, sales force hiring, dependencies with partners, and so on

### Chapter 22: The Problem with Product Roadmaps

- at least half of product ideas do not work
- even when ideas prove to be valuable, they take several iterations to get the execution of this idea to the point where it delivers the expected business value that management was hoping for; aka `time to money`
- if we can prototype and test ideas with users, customers, engineers, and business stakeholders in hours and days -- rather than in weeks and months -- it changes dynamics and most important the results
- anytime you put a list of ideas on a document entitled roadmap, people view it as a commitment

### Chapter 23: The Alternative to Roadmaps

- product teams need to have the necessary business context
  - they need to have a solid understanding of where the company is heading
  - they need to know how their particular team is supposed to contribute to the larger purpose
- Two main components that provide this context:
  - product vision and strategy
  - business objectives

### Chapter 24: Product Vision and Product Strategy

- **product vision** describes the future we are trying to create, typically somewhere between two and five years out
  - how we plan to accomplish our mission
  - persuasive piece that might be in the form of a storyboard, a narrative such as a white paper, or a special type of prototype referred to as a visiontype
  - buying into a vision is always a bit of a leap of faith
- **product strategy** is our sequence of products or releases we plan to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision
  - we often structure each product/market fit around a different customer or user persona
  - could also be based on geography
  - focus on a single target market at a time
  - besides significantly increasing your chance of delivering sometime that can power your business, the product strategy now gives you a tool to align your product work with your sales and marketing organizations

### Chapter 25: Principles of Product Vision

1. Start with why
1. Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution
1. Don't be afraid to think big with vision
1. Don't be afraid to disrupt yourself, because if you don't, someone else will
1. The product vision needs to inspire
1. Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends
1. Skate to where the puck is heading, not to where it was
1. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details
1. Realize that any product vision is a leap of faith
1. Evangelize continuously and relentlessly

### Chapter 26: Principles of Product Strategy

1. Focus on one target market or persona at a time
1. Product strategy needs to be aligned with business strategy
  - the vision is meant to inspire, but the organization ultimately is there to come up with solutions that deliver on the business strategy
1. Product strategy needs to be aligned with sales and go-to-market strategy
1. Obsess over customers, not over competitors
1. Communiciate the strategy across the organization

### Chapter 27: Product Principles

- nature of the products you want to create
- aligned with the product vision for an entire product line
- example: `In cases where the needs of the buyers and the sellers conflict, we will prioritize the needs of the buyers, because that's actually the most important thing we can do for sellers`

### Chapter 28: The OKR Technique

- Objectives and Key Results (OKR) technique is a tool for management, focus, and alignment

1. Objectives should be qualitative; key results need to be quantitative/measurable
1. Key results should be a measure of business results, not output or tasks
1. The rest of the company will use OKRs a bit differently, but for the product management, design, and technology organization, focus on the organization's objectives and the objectives for each product team, which are designed to roll up and achieve the organization's objectives. Don't let personal objectives or functional team objectives dilute or confus the focus.
1. Find a good cadence for your organization
1. Keep the number of objectives and key results for the organization and for each team small (1-3 is typical)
1. It's critical that every product team *track their active progress* against their objectives (typically weekly)
1. The objectives should cover what the team *needs to accomplish*
1. It's important that teams feel accountable to achieving their objectigves. If they fail substantially, it's worth having a post-mortem / retrospective with some of their peers or management
1. Agree as an organization on how you will be evaluating or scoring your key results
1. Establish very clear and consistent ways to indicate when a key result is in reality a high-integrity commitment rather than a normal objective
1. Be very transparent on what objectives each product team is working on and their current progress
1. Senior management (CEO and executive team) is responsible for the organiztaion's objectives and key results. The heads of product and technology are responsible for the product team objectives (and ensuring they deliver on the organization's objectives). The individual product teams are responsible for proposing the key results for each objective they've been assigned. It is normal to have a give-and-take process each quarter as the OKRs are finalized for each team and for the organization.

### Chapter 30: Product Objectives @ Scale

- with startups or small organizations, when everone essentially knows what everyone else is doing and why, it's normal for each product team to propose their objectives and key results
- larger burden on leadership and management to ensure that the organization is truly aligned, that each and every product team understands how they fit into the mix, and what they are there to contribute

### Chapter 31: Product Evangelism

- "selling the dream"
- helping people imagine the future and inspiring them to create that future
- helps to have a team of missionaries and evangelism is a key responsibility to make this happen

#### How to Sell the Dream

1. Use a prototype
1. Share the pain
1. Share the vision
1. Share learnings generously
1. Share credit generously
1. Learn how to give a great demo
1. Do your homework
1. Be genuinely excited
1. Learn to show some enthusiasm
1. Spend time with your team

## Part IV: The Right Process

- the right process is not any *single* process; it's a combination of techniques mindset and culture

### Product Discovery

- discovering in detail what the customer solution needs to be
  - includes everything from making sure there are enough customers that even need this solution and then coming up with a solution that works for our customers and for our business
  - needs to be a single solution that works for many customers
- ensuring we deliver a robust and scalable implementation that our customers can depend on for consistently reliable value
  - teams needs to be able to release with confidence
- while we are in a big hurry to push something out to learn what works and what doesn't, we don't want to release something that isn't ready for prime time and risk hurting our customers and damaging our brand
- purpose of product discovery is to make sure we have some evidence that when we ask the engineers to build a production-quality product, it won't be a wasted effort
- key to effective product discovery is getting access to our cusotmers without trying to push our quick experiments into production
- if you want to discover great products, it really is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often
- if you want to delivery great products, use best practices for engineering and try not to override the engineers' concerns

### Chapter 33: Principles of Product Discovery

- purpose of discovery
  - will the customer buy this or choose to use it? (`value risk`)
  - can the user figure out how to use it? (`usability risk`)
  - can we build it? (`feasibility risk`)
  - does this solution work for our business (`business viability risk`)
- we need to collect evidence; not rely on opinion or gut instinct

1. We know we can't count on our customers (or our executives or stakeholders) to tell us what to build. It's our job to make sure the solution we deliver solves the underlying problem
1. The most important th ing is to establish compelling value
1. Coming up with a good user experience is usually even harder, and more critical to success
1. Functionality, design, and technology are inherently intertwined
1. We expect that many of our ideas won't work out, and the ones that do will require several iterations
1. We must validate our ideas on real users and customers
  - need to do this before we spend the time and expense to build a product that people do not want
1. Our goal in discovery is to validate our ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible
1. We need to validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after
1. We need to validate the business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after
1. It's about shared learning

### Discovery Framing Techniques

- help us quickly identify the underlying issues that must be tackled during product discovery
- if we're handling a potential solution, we need to clarify the underlying problem to be solved
- need to tease out the risks and dtermine where it makes sense to focus our time
- ensure we understand how our work fits in with the work of other teams
- two goals:
  - ensure the team is on the same page in terms of clarity of purpose and alignment
    - need to agree on the business objective we're focused on, the specific problem we are intending to solve for our customers, which user or customers you're solving that problem for, and how you will know if you've succeeded
    - should align directly to your product team's objectives and key results
  - identify big risks that need to be tackled during discovery work
- types of risk to consider:
  - value risk -- do customers want this particular problem solved and is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?
  - business risk -- does the solution we came up with in discovery work for different parts of our copmany
  - financial risk -- can we afford this solution
  - business development risk -- does thsi solution work for our partners
  - marketing risk - is this solution consistent with our brand
  - sales risk - is this solution something our sales staff is equipped to sell?
  - legal risk - is this something we can do from a legal or compliance perspective
  - ethical risk - is this solution something we shoudl do?
- use discovery time and validation techniques for those situations in which we know there's a significant risk or where members of the team disagree
- FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION

### Chapter 35: Opportunity Assessment Technique

1. What business objective is this work intended to address? (Objective)
1. How will you know if you've succeeded? (Key results)
1. What problem will this solve for our customers? (Customer problem)
1. What type of cusotmer are we focused on? (Target market)

- need to ensure that every member of your product team knows and understands the answers to these four questions before you jump into your product discovery work

### Chapter 36: Customer Letter Technique

- working backward process where you start the effort with a pretend press release
- frame the work ahead of the team by writing an imagined press release of what it would be like once this product launches. How does it improve the life of our customers? What are the real benefits to them? You've all read a press release before -- the only difference is that this is entirely imagined. It is describing a future state we want to create
- actual reader of this press release is the product team, related or impacted teams, and leadership
  - if people do not see the value after reading the press release then the product manage has more work to do or perhaps should reconsider the effort
- another approach: write a letter to the CEO with the perspective of a happy and impressed customer that explains why they are so happy and grateful for a new product or redesign
  - also include an imagined congratulatory response from the CEO to the product team explaining how this has helped the business

### Chapter 37: Startup Canvas Technique

- being asked to invent an entirely new product
- have a broader set of risks, including validating your value proposition
- figure out how you intend to make money, how you plan to get this product out to your customers and sell to them, how much it will cost to produce and sell this product, and what you will measure to track your pgress -- not to mention determining whether the market is large enough to sustain a business

### Discovery Planning Techniques

- identifying the bigger challenges and planning how you'll attack this work

### Chapter 38: Story Map Technique

> These are two-dimensional maps, in which major user activities are arrayed along the horizontal dimension, loosely ordered by time from left to right. So, if there are a dozen major user activities, they would be along the top from left to right, generally in the order you would do them -- or at least, if you were describing the overal system to someone else, the order in which you'd describe them
>
> Along the vertical dimension, we have a progressive level of detail. As we flesh out each major activit yinto sets of user tasks, we add stories for each of those tasks. The critical tasks are higher vertically than the optional tasks.

- once each story has context, the entire team can see how it fits with the other stories
- use story map to frame our prototypes and then as we get feedback, we can easily update the story map to serve as a living reflection of the prototypes
- as we finalize discovery work and progress to delivery, the stories from the map move right into the product backlog

### Chapter 39: Customer Discovery Program Technique

- refernce customers are: **real** customers who are running your product in **production**. They have paid **real money** for the product and are willing to **tell others** how much they love your product
- develop a set of reference customers in parallel with discovering and developing the actual product
- the more references custoemrs the better, but too few means we might be designing the product that only works for one or two customers
- try to develop 6 reference customers in our specific target market or segement
- we want custoemrs that truly feel the pain and are near desparate for the solution we want to build
- the benefit reference customers get is having **real input** to the solution and they get something that does actually work for them
- benefit to product team is you get access to a set of users and customers that you can go deep with and figure out a solution that will work for them
  - they've provided you access to their users
  - they have agreed to test early versions
  - they have agreed to buy the product and serve as a public reference if the resulting product works for them
- our job is to come up with a general product, but you have to be committed to coming up with a product that works extremely well for the reference customer
- dive deep with each of the six customers and identify a single solution that works well for all its custoemrs
- treat these early prospective customers as development partners
  - you are in it together
  - treat them as colleagues; you are building relationships that last years
- will show them prototypes and test with their users
  - ask detailed questions and testing early versions in their environment
- release the delivered product to these people before the general release and make sure they are live and happy before release
  - when you release, they will be ready to stand up for you
- for API-based products, we need reference applications not reference customer

### Discovery Ideation Techniques

- designed to provide the product team with a wealth of promising solutions aimed at the problems we're focused on now
- "how do we generate the types of ideas that are likely to turly help us solve the hard business problems that our leaders have sked us to focus on right now?"
- if the product team is given actual business problems to solve rather t han solutions, and the product team does their job and interacts directly and frequently with actual users and customers, then getting a sufficient quantity and quality of product ideas is not really a problem
- make sure you test your ideas to ensure they are valuable and usable for our customers, are feasible for engineers, and are viable for our business

### Chapter 41: Customer Interviews

- one of the most powerful and improtant skills for any product manager and very often the source or inspiration for many breakthrough product ideas
- things we want to understand:
  - Are your customers who you think they are?
  - Do they really have the problems you think they have?
  - How does the customer solve this problem today?
  - What would be requried for them to switch?
- good opportunity to try out some product ideas, it can help us answer key questions
  - you can wrap up the interview with a user test of your latest product ideas

#### Tips to get the most out of Customer Interviews

- **frequency** - establish a regular cadence of customer interviews
- **purpose** - not trying to prove anything, but trying to understand and learn quickly
- **recruiting users and customers** - talk primarily to people in your intended target market
- **location** - try to observe custoemrs in their native habitat
- **preparation** - be clear beforehand about what problem you think they have and think about how you'll either confirm or contrdict that
- **who should attend** - product manager, product designer, and one of the engineers from the team
- **interview** - keep things natural and informal, ask open-ended questions, and try to learn what they're doing today (we do care about what they wish they were doing, but it's not as important)
- **afterwards** - brief with the team to see if y'all heard the same thigns and had the same learnings

### Chapter 42: Concierge Test Technique

- become the concierge
  - do what the customer needs to do
  - you might need to learn how to do it, but you are in their shoes doing the tasks they would do
- requires going out to actual users and customers and asking them to show you how they work so that you can learn how to do their job
  - this will allow you to create a much better solution
- if you are building a customer-enabling product, the users may be employees of your company, but the technique is the same
  - ask your colleagues how to do their job

### Chapter 43: The Power of Customer Misbehavior

- figure out the ways customers use our products to solve problems other than what we planned for and officially support

### Chapter 44: Hack Days

- undirected -- people can explore whatever product ideas they like as long as it's loosely related to the mission of the company
- directed -- there is a customer problem and we ask people to self-organize and work on any diea they like that might address this objective

### Discovery Prototyping Techniques

> Plan to throw one away; you will , ayhow

### Chapter 45: Principles of Prototypes

1. The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product. All forms of prototype should require at least an order of magnitude less time and effort as the eventual product
1. Realize that one of the key benefits of any form of prototypes is to force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper level than if we just talk about it or write something down. This is why the very act of creating a prototype so often exposes major issues otherwise left uncovered until much later
1. Collaboration. Members of the product team and business partners can all experience the prototype to develop shared understanding
1. The fidelity refers to how realistic the prototype looks; we create the right level of fidelity for its intended purpose and we acknolwedge that lower fidelity is faster and cheaper than higher fidelity, so we only do higher fidelity when we need to
1. The primary purpose of a prototype is to trakcle one or more product risks (value, usabilility, feasibility, or viability) in discovery ; the prototype goes on to provide a second benfit, which is to communicate to the engineers and broader organization what needs to be built

### Chapter 46: Feasibility Prototype Technique

- There are several situations wherein your engineers may identify a significant feasibility risk involved in solving a particular problem they are working on:
  - algorithm concerns
  - performance concerns
  - scalability concerns
  - fault tolerance concerns
  - use of a technology the team has not used before
  - use of a third-party component or service the team has not used before
  - use of a legacy system the team has not used before
  - dependency on new or related changes by other teams
- the main technique used for tackling these types of risks is for one or more of the engineers to build a feasbility prototype
- an engineer will create the feasibility prototype because it is typically code
  - this is intended to be throwaway code -- it's okay to be quick and dirty
  - we just want to collect enough data to show that performance would likely be acceptable or not

### Chapter 47: User Prototype Techniques

- a low-fidelity user prototype doesn't look real -- it's essentially an interactive wireframe
- high-fidelity user prototypes are user simulations that look and feel real

### Chapter 48: Live-Data Prototype Technique

- we might have to collect actual usage data to address a major risk in discovery
- live-data prototype is a very limited implementation
- not a production product; does not have full set of use cases, automated tests, full analytics instrumentation, internaltionalization and localization, performance and scalability, SEO work, and so forth
- live-data prototype is substantially smaller than the eventual product; the bar is lower in terms of quality, performance, and functionality
- we only instrument the specific use case we are testing
- it's improtant that actual users use the live-data prototype for real work and that we capture real data we can compare to our current product (or to expectations)

### Chapter 49: Hybrid Prototype Technique

- Wizard of Oz prototype combines the front-end user experience of a high-fidelity user prototype but with an actual person behind the scenes perfoming manually what would ultimately be handled by automation

### Discovery Testing Techniques

### Chapter 50: Testing Usability

- do this in discovery using prototypes
- usually do usability testing with a high-fidelity prototype
- when we do a usability and/or value test, it's with the product manager, the product designer, and one of the engineers from the team
- need to define in advance the set of tasks you want to test
  - there may also be more obscure tasks, but concentrate on the priary tasks
- one person should administer the usability test and another person should tak notes
  - good to debrief so you can make sure you saw the same things and came to the same conclusions
- learn how the customer things about the this problem today; this will help you figure out if they really have the problem you think
  - tell the user that this is a prototype
  - see if they can tell from the landing page what might be valuable or appealing to them
  - when testing, you'll want to do everything you can to keep your users in use mode and out of critque mode
    - can the user easily do the tasks they need to
  - keep quiet
  - what you are looking for
    - the user got thru the task with no problem at all and no help
    - the user struggled and moaned a bit, but eventually got thru it
    - the user got so frustrated he gave up
  - you're trying to get an understanding of how your target users think about this problem and to identify places in your prototype where the model the software presents is inconsistent or incomptible with how the user is thinking about the problem
- summarize your learning; might also require you to iterate on your prototype
  - no reason to show each user the same thing if you can fix and improve

### Chapter 51: Testing Value

- the customer must perceive your product to be substantially better to motivate them to buy your product and then wade through the pain and obstacles of migrating from their old solution
- good product teams spend most of their time on creating value
  - if value is there, we can fix everything else
  - if not, how good usability, reliability, or performance does not matter
- it makes sense to test if there is demand for what we want to build
- most common time of qualitative value testing is focused on the response or reaction
- we test for efficacy, i.e. how well the solution solves the underlying problem

### Chapter 52: Demand Testing Techniques

- fake door demand test is to put a button or menu item into the user experience exactly hwere we believe it should be
  - when the user clicks that button, instead of taking the user to the new feature, it takes them to a special page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new feature and you are seeking custoemrs to talk to about this
- helps figure out demand when implementation costs are substantial

### Chapter 53: Qualitative Value Testing Techniques

- every user you test is like another pie ce of the puzzle
  - eventually you see enough of the puzzle that you can understand where you've gone wrong
- qualitative testing of product ideas with real users and custoemrs is the single most important discovery activity for you and your product team
- begin the user test with a short user interview to make sure that our user has the problems we think they have, how they solve the problems today, and what would it take for them to switch
- during the usability test, we test to see whether the user can figure out how to operate our product
  - after this test, the user knows what your product is all about and how it's meant to be used
- to test usability and value, the user needs to be able to use a high-fidelity user prototype
- gauging value is to see if the user would be willing to pay for it, even if you have no intention of charging them
- would they recommend the product to a friend, 1-10
- would they be willing to spend time to work with us on the product?
- if you show your prototype to two different people and get different responses, your job is to try to figure out why

### Chapter 54: Quantitative Value Testing Techniques

- sometimes we collect enough data that we have statistically significant results, other times we collect enough usage data that we have *useful evidence*
- use a live data prototype to capture this information
- in *discover A/B* testing, we have the current product showing to 99% of users and the live data prototype showing to 1% of users
- we shoudl be anonymizing and aggregating data so there is nothing personally identifiable

#### Role of Analytics

- Understand user and customer behavior
  - identify features that are not being used or to confirm that features are being used as we expect
  - helps gain a better understanding of the difference between what people say and what they actually do
- Measure product progress
- Prove whether product ideas work
- Inform product decisions
- Inspire product work

### Chapter 55: Testing Feasibility

- Do we know *how* to build this?
- Do we have the *skills* on the team to build this?
- Do we have enough *time* to build this?
- Do we need any *architectural* changes to build this?
- Do we have on hand all the *components* we need to build this?
- Do we understand the *dependencies* involved in building this?
- Will the *performance* be acceptable?
- Will it *scale* to the levels we need?
- Do we have the *infrastructure* necessary to test and run this?
- Can we afford the *cost* to provision this?

### Chapter 56: Testing Business Viability

- making sure that product solutions your team is proposing will work within the constraints of each of these areas
- for stakeholders that are impacted, it's important that they have a chance to review the proposal and ensure their concerns have been addressed

### Transformation Techniques

### Chapter 58: Discovery Sprint Techniques

- **discovery sprint** is a one-week time box of product discovery work, designed to tackle a substantial problem or risk your product team is facing
- you and your team will explore dozens of different product ideas and approaches with the goal of solving some significant business problem

### Chapter 59: Pilot Team Technique

- **pilot teams** allow the roll out of change to a limited part of the organization before implementing it more broadly

### Chapter 60: Weaning an Organization Off Roadmaps

- teams work on the prioritized business objectives determined by the leaders; we share our key results transparently; and we commit to high-integrity commitments when critical delivery dates are needed

### Chapter 61: Managing Stakeholders

- if you want the latitude to come up with the most-effective solutions, then it's critically important that the product manager convince each of these stakeholders that she not only understands the issues, but that she is committed to coming up with solutiosn that not only work for the customer, but also work for the stakeholder as well
- commit to previewing your solutions during discovery with the key stakeholders before you put this work on the product backlog
  - high-fiedlity user prototypes are ideal for this

### Chapter 62: Communicating Product Learnings

- big learnings are important to share broadly, especially when things don't go as hoped. As a side benefit, sometimes someone in the audience has an isnight about what might explain the results

## Part V: The Right Culture

### Chapter 64: Good Product Team / Bad Product Team

- Good teams have a compelling product vision that they pursue with a missionary-like passion. Bad teams are mercenaries.
- Good teams get their inspiration and product ideas from their vision and objectives, from observing customers' struggle, from analyzing the data customers generate from using their product and from constantly seeking to apply new technolgy to sovle real problems. Bad teams gather requirements from sales and customers.
- Good teams understand who each of their key stakeholders are, they understand the constraints that these stakeholders operate in, and they are committed to inventing solutions that work not just for users and customers, but also work within the constraints of the business. Bad teams gather requirements from stakeholders.
- Good teams are skilled in the many techniques to rapdily try out product ideas to determine which ones are truly worth building. Bad teams hold meetings to generate prioritized roadmaps.
- Good teams love to have brainstorming discussions with smart thought leaders from across the company. Bad teams get offended when someone outside their team dares to suggest they do something.
- Good teams have product, design, and engineering sit side by side, and they embrace the give and take between the functionality, the user experience, and the enabling technology. Bad teams sit in their respective silos, and ask that others make requests for their services int he form of documents and scheduling meetings.
- Good teams are constantly trying out new ideas to innovate, but doing so in ways that protect the revenue and protect the brand. Bad teams are still waiting for permission to run a test.
- Good teams insist the have the skill sets on their team, such as strong product design, necessary to create winning products. Bad teams don't even know what product designers are.
- Good teams ensure that their engineers have time to try out the prototypes in discovery every day so that they can contribute their thoughts on how to make the product better. Bad teams show the prototypes to the engineers during sprint planning so they can estimate.
- Good teams engage directly with end users and customers every week, to better understand their customers, and to see the customer's response to their latest ideas. Bad tems think they are the customer.
- Good teams know that many of their favourite ideas won't end up working for customers, and even the ones that could will need several iterations to get to the point where they provide the desired outcome. Bad teams just build what's on the roadmap, and are satisfied with meeting dates and ensuring quality.
- Good teams understand the need for speed and how rapid iteration is the key to innovation, and they understand this speed comes from teh right techniques and not forced labor. Bad teams complain they are slow because their colleagues are not working hard enough.
- Good teams make high-integrity commitments after they've evaluated the request and ensured they understand this speed comes from the right techniques and not forced labor. Bad teams complain they are slow because their colleagues are not working hard enough.
- Good teams make high-integrity commitments after they've evaluted the request and ensured they have a viable solution that will work for the customer and business. Bad teams complain about being a sales-driven organization.
- Good teams instrument their work so they can immedicately understand how their product is being used and make adjustments based on the data. Bad teams consider analytics and reporting a nice to have.
- Good teams integrate and release continuously, knowing that a constant stream of smaller releases provides a much more stable solution for their customers. Bad teams test manually at the end of a painful integration phase and then release everythign at once.
- Good teams obsess over their reference customers. Bad teams obsess over their competitors
- Good teams celebrate when they achieve a significant impact to the business results. Bad teams celebrate when they finally release something.

### Chapter 65: Top Reasons for Loss of Innovation

Companies stop innovating since they lose one or more of the following:

1. Customer-centric culture
1. Compelling product vision
1. Focused product strategy -- needs to spell out al ogical and intentional sequence of target markets for the product teams to focus on
1. Strong product managers
1. Stable product teams
1. Engineers in discovery
1. Corporate courage
1. Empowered product teams
1. Product mindset
1. Time to innovate -- it's very possible that your product teams are entirely consumed just doing what will keep the lights on (fixing bugs, implementing capabilities for different parts of the business, addressing technical debt)

### Chapter 66: Top Reasons for Loss of Velocity

1. Techincal Debt
1. Lack of strong product managers
1. Lack of delivery management
1. Infrequent release cycle
1. Lack of product vision and strategy
