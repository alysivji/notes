# The 7 Principles of Public Speaking

By Richard Zeoli

## Principle 1: Perception

> Stop trying to be a gerat public speaker

* The best public speakers are those who seem to genuinely enjoy giving a speech
* Great speakers speak to us, not at us
* **Be prepared**
* Time feels different at the podium than it does for the audience
* Accomplished communicators handle questions by taking a few seconds to organize their thoughts before giving a carefullly constructed answer
* Know your audience (this might involve some research)
* Know the material inside and out. Pratice the material inside and out. Be able to give the speech without the benefits of having a written speech in front of you (but have notes that you can refer to as needed)
* Approach humor with caution
* Thank event host, organizers, staff, and any volunteers for their hard work
* Approach publicspeaking as a conversation with the audience rather than as a "speech"

## Principle 2: Perfection

> When you make a mistake, no one cares but you

* People's attention spans constantly wander, chances are they won't even know you made a mistake
* Need to write a speech to draw people's attention in
    * Eye Contact
        * Signals to people that they need to pay attention
        * Makes people feel important and makes them feel like you care about them
    * Tone & Pitch
        * Write remarks with phrases designed for vocal inflection (verbal cue to pay attention)
        * Write lines that cause your voice to naturally go up and down, even to the point of becoming quiet
        * People are with you during the intro and conclusion, we need to keep their minds from wandering during the middle
        * Try to insert a line that allows the tone of your voice to go up and/or down at elast once or twice in each paragraph
    * Dramatic Pause
        * Sends cue to listener to tune in because something good is coming
        * Always feels longer to speaker than to the audience so don't rush it

## Principle 3: Visualization

> If you can see it, you can speak it

* We might be born with a natural potential for a talent, but it takes a lot of training to bring this potential front and center
* Practice in your mind, visualize yourself succeeding and you will
* If you picture with intensity the scenarios you want,  your mind has a funny way of making them happen

## Principle 4: Discipline

> Practice makes good

* Practicing consistently will make you good
* Stand in front of a mirror and watch yourself talk. Look for mannerisms. The more you do it, the more comfortable you will feel
* The five minutes before you are speaking are the most cruical as a speaker
    * Mentally picture yourself successfully taking the podium and addressing the crowd
    * Tell yourself positive affirmations that wll help you succeed
    * *I am prepared. I know this material. I know this topic. The audience is going to understand the depth of knowledge and appreciate my subject matter. But I recognize that not 100 of the audience will feel this way and that's okay. I am prepared. I am ready
* When you tell yourself you are a champion, you will act like a champion

## Principle 5: Description

> Make it personal, become a storyteller

* People don't care about facts as much as they care about feelings
* Don't inundate people with data, tell them something interesting, something that will help them grow while capturing their attention, something that they can take away with them
* How to structure your story
    * Buy index cards
    * Write down facts about the memorable moments related to this topic. One card for each moment
        * No thought is too insignificant at the initial stage
    * Go thru each card and fill the feeling surround the facts
    * Write down everything: failures, successes, great moments you wish could happen again, moments you wish never happened, people you met along the way
    * Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end
        * As you speak, your job is to take your listeners on a journey with you. Bring them with you as you take your new job, start your new business, and face the struggles that are an inevitable part of any new venture
        * Soon your story will take shape: you're telling the audience about a memorable event in yoru life and then you're telling them *why* it was memorable and *how* it affected you

## Principle 6: Inspiration

> Speak to serve

* The most important person in the room is the audience
    * Serve the audience by talking about something that interests them or by making an otherwise uninteresting topic interesting
* Effective communicators are the ones who not only make us feel comfortable and relaxed but also have a purpose in what they're tryign to say. When we listen to them, we understand our personal stake in the subject.
* While preparing and presenting, always think about how you can help the audience members achieve their goals. It will force you to come up with more details and examples to make your speech engaging
    * How can I serve my listeners?
    * How can I make this clear to them?
    * How can I show them what's at stake for them?
    * How can I show them how I can make their life, company, product or service better?
* Never state what you do as a matter of fact, explain it in a way that shows how the audience will benefit from what you do

## Principle 7: Anticipation

> Always leave your audience wantng more

* less is usually more
* How long should a speech be? Long enough to convey all the necessary information and not a second longer. As speakers, we must always maintain the goal of getting in and getting out. And of course convey the information somehwere in between. Do it in a way that's informative. Make it enjoyable, and then give your listeners the opportunity to get on with their lives
* How do you know when enough is enough?
    * You have to make sure that you have effectively proven your thesis
    * Then summarize your point, plug your shit, thank the audience, and get out

## Bonus Principle: Staying on Message

* Before you can prove your point, you must first prove your credibility before your audience. Only then will they believe you have the expertise to know what you are talking about
* Gain credibility by talking about your experience, educational background, awards, published articles, specific knowledge, research, past accomplishments, detailed plan of action
* Once you establish credibility, it's time to prove your point while staying on message using examples and stories
* Consider your message like a laser beam. Everything you say should be used to support your message with precision
* If it doesn't support your message, replace it with something that does
* Simply stating experience isn't as powerful or effective as telling a story that shows experience
* "Show, don't tell" You ust show the audience how you feel rather than telling them
* Story along with picture does so much ot prove your point and make the presentation more valuable than a picture alone
* When a speaker shows the visual, tells the story, makes it personal, and puts it into human terms to which we can all relate, that speaker is taking the visual to the next level
