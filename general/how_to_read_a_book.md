## Part 1: Dimensions of Reading

### Chatper 1: The Activity and Art of Reading

- book is for those whose main purpose in reading books is to gain increased understanding
- readers are people who gain a large share of their information about and their understanding of the world from the written word
- media packages opinions into people's mind and then he pushes play on the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so; works without thinking
- all reading must be to some degree active
- one reader is better than another if he demands more of himself and of the text before him
- reader / listener is like a catcher in baseball, i.e. works with the pitcher aka author / speaker
- successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds its way into the reader's possession
  - the amount the reader "catches" will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved
- **art of reading** is the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations
  - mind passes from understanding less to understanding more
- distinction between
  - reading for information -- reading newspapers / anything that is at ocne thoroughly intelligible to us; increase our store of information, but they cannot improve our understanding
  - reading for understanding -- when a person tries to read something that at first he does not completely undrestanding; the thing to be read is better / higher than the reader
    - conditions under which reading for understanding takes place
      - initial inequality in understanding -- writer must be superior to the reader in understanding and the book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his potential readers lack
      - reader must be able to over this inequality to some degree
    - learning from our "betters"
- to be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in which respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth
  - differences between being able to remember something and being able to explain it
- ways of learning
  - learning by discovery -- the process of learning something by research, by investigtion, or by reflection, without being taught
  - learning by instruction -- occurs when one person teaches another through speech or writing
- art of reading includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery
  - keenness of observation
  - readily available memory
  - range of imagination
  - an intllect trained in analysis and reflection
- reading is learning by discovery, but with an instructor
- listening is learning from a teacher that is present vs reading is learning from one who is absent

> Students in school often read difficult books with the help and guidance of teachers. But for those of us who are not in school, and indeed also for those of us who are when we try to read books that are not required or assigned, our continuing education depends mainly on books alone, read without a teacher's help. Therefore if we are disposed to go on learning and discovering, we must know how to make books teach us well. That, indeed, is the primary goal of this book.
