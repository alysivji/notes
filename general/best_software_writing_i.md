# The Best Software Writing I

## Adam Bosworth - ICSOC04 Talk

> It is an ironic truth that those who seek to create systems that most assume the perfectibility of humans end up building the systems that are the most soul destroying and most rigid

> Software which is flexible, simple, sloppy, tolerant, and altogether forgiving of human foibles and weaknesses turns out to be actually the most steel-cored, able to survive and grow, while software which is demanding, abstract, rich, but systematized turns out to collapse in on itself in a slow and grim implosion

> Text search on Google: engineering is hard, but the user model is simple and sloppy

> code is just a hammer they use to do the job
