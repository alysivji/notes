## Introduction: Developers Are a Big Deal. Marketing to Them Shouldn't Be

- If you, or your team, work in *developer relations*, your responsibility is to build credibility, trust, and influence. You will find yourself evangelising for your company by representing it at events, blogging and on social media, typically taking the role of a community manager. You will likely have the technical chops to write sample code and run demos. Developer relations is also about advocating for the external developers you encounter, representing them by giving their feedback to your technical teams to influence their product roadmap and strategy, and inputting defect reports and feature requests. Your role is a balance between representing the needs of external developers and evangelising your company's product
- If you work in *developer marketing*, your role is to encourage third- party devleoeprs to learn about, try, adopt, use, and even contribute to a software product. To be credible in front of a developer audience, you need to be able to communicate about your product at a detailed level without unnecessary marketing jargon or BS. This probably means having a technical background or at lest sufficient experience in your domain to ensure you are taken seriously. Activitivies you would expect to be engaged in include creating the developer marketing strategy segementation of developers into personas, organizing social media, content marketing and email campagins, planning events and conferences, and steering developer rewards programs, developer advocacy programs, and innovator funding/incubator programs.
- *developer product engineering* will build and deliver an SDK or API to third-party defvelopers. You will be responsible for the strategy, roadmpa, and development of the tools and code needed in the SDK, and the technical content surrounding it, such as sample code and technical documentation. In the developer product engineering team, you will need the skills to provide answers in technical forums, write blog posts, and create content for webinars, video tutorials and trainig courses. And, if you are ain devloper marketing or devloper relations, members of this team will be your go-to folks
- Developers are particularly averse to generic, aggressive or reptitive messaging about tools, products, and services. Instead they want relevant and meaningful information and the opportunity to make up their own minds.
- This book isn't a step-by-step guide to writing a developer marketing strategy, but instead a toolbox for you to gain the knowledge and practical undrestanding needed to work with your audience

## Chapter 1: Using Developer Personas to Stay Customer-Obsessed

- need to define what you want to achieve and what success looks like to keep your team aligned
- as products are built and brought to market, they should also carry a means of measuring success
- the team needs a shared definition of where they are going and how they know when they have been successful
- our developer personas became core team assets and a variable in our business planning - we structured our offfers and programs based on the business and life goals of each persona, we included them in our marketing agency briefs, and we even based our competitive analysis on the personas
- magic of personas is that they provide a composite view of a larger audience, and they allow you to make that audience a part of your product's narrative
- developer personas provide an easy way for non-develoeprs to understand this audience

### What is a Developer Persona?

> Wikipedia describes a persona as "a fictional character crated to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way... a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users... They are captured in 1-2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a relastic character

#### Examples

- "Mort", the ooportunistic developer, likes to create quick-working solutions for immediate problems and focuses on productivity and learn as needed
- "Elvis", the pragmatic programmer, likes to create long-lasting solutions addressing the problem domain, and learn while working on the solution
- "Einstein", the paranoid programmer, likes to create the most efficient solution to a given problem, and typically learn in advance before working on the solution

### Personas vs Market Segments

- the use of market segments is most handy on the business-oriented side of the house because they're easy to build marketing programs upon. You can cleanly size an opportunity, you can build a lookalike audience pretty simply, and you can measure the ROI of your campaign using easily observable audience attributes
- the idea of a market segmenet is similar to a persona -- market segmentation tends to be a qunatitative or data-drive process . -- user personas tend to be a qualitative process, using internal personal drivers and motivations
- Personas for product and campaign creation
  - tend to focus on the needs of your audience, what drives their adoption and usage of your offering
- Market segmentation for execution and measuring the success of what you take to market
  - rely on observable characteristics of your audience -- where they are and what they do
- find a way to map personas to segements

### Characteristics of a Persona

- Basic Demographics -- to make this person real, give them a name and create a composite of who they are using what you already know about your target developer audience, perhaps anchoring on someone you met at a recent event that you think well reprsents your user base
  - Age? Where do they live? Where do they work?
- Customer Journey
  - How does the developer's world interface with your product or platform?
  - What does their journey gernally look like as they move through tie world, and as they make contact with yours
- Motivations and Aspirations
  - What drives this individual?
  - Why do they do what they do?
  - What motivates them?
  - What inspires them?
  - Who inspires them?
  - Where do they want to go?
- Pain Points and Fears
  - What keeps them u pat night?
  - What do they dread?
  - What do they fear?
  - What are their blind-spots?
- Inflection points (adoption triggers)
  - What are the marjor moments in their life as it relates to your offering?
  - What moves them to the point of making a change?
  - What is the process for exploring that change?
- Adoption Facilitators
  - What can you do for these personas?

- once you have your basic character story written out, then you're ready to flesh it out with market trend data and facts
  - Use survey data and syndicated research that summarizes larger market trends around my audience
- use insights around the customer journey and adoption decisions to build a marketing plan around each audience

- messaging framework should be tailored to each of the personas
- personas are useful in evaluating the usability of the platforms we are marketing
  - by undrestanding each persona's perspective and assumptions, you can properly build and position a product to that audience
- share a common persona set between marketing and engineering
  - all teams ahre a common lens for designing and building your product
- talk to your target customers and understand their story
  - visit them in their work environment
  - talk to them at events

### Developing Personas

- write down everything you find interesting in the characteristics of a persona
- look for commonalities
- as you group, define 3-5 characteristics of that group

## Chapter 2: Successful Developer Email Marketing

> To stand out from the crowd, marketers have to blend creativity with data, tailoring their content to be relevant to their audience and reaching them at the right time, in the right palce. And if you're working in developer marketing you have a particular challenge because tranditionally , developers hate marketing. They want communication to be authenic and userful. Keeping that in mind, it's essential to take an honest look at developer email marketing ask tough questions such as:
>
> - Will the reader think we're trying to sell them something?
> - Are we using a devleoper-driven approach?
> - Are we pushing our products or services rather than creating value and trust?

- our task is to connect and drive delvopers to adopt our product; we do this by using engaging content that keeps them coming back to us
- craft content, messaging, and campaigns with our end-goal of product adoption in mind
- track and measure results, collect data across platforms and use what we've learned along the way to optimize going forward

### Data

- aim to accurately meausre every interaction
- once we have data, we can personalize our content, connecting with our audience in a more meaningful way

> Tracking performance is the key to success. Equally as important is having benchmarks and goals in place to see how you're improving. To get started, do a quick online search for industry standards for delivery, open rates, and click-throughs. CRms such as HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Marketo will periodically publish current bechmarks that you can use as a guide.
>
> The insights you receive about your audience based on the data you collect makes all of the efforts and obstacles worthwile. You can get the complete picture of a person's journey to conversion, and it gives you an inside look at what marketing approaches are working, as well as what could be improved. Marketing is only as good as its data. The more you know about your audience, what's working, and what's not, the higher your return on investment

### Trigger-based Campaigns

> Trigger-based campaigns are based on customer interactions with your content (e.g. subscription, page visits, product adoption). They help to drive peopel through the funnel in a very personalized way. With these campaigns, you can map out the customer journey more precisely and make decisions based on real data. What brought them to your content? Did they take action after your first email? Did your reminder emails drive them to conversion? How many times did you 'touch' them before they adopted your product?
>
> Trigger-based campaigns are definitely not simple, but they are worth it because you gain a better undertanding of the unique journey each person takes on their path to conversion. These campaigns also help to shwocase which points alon gthe way are successfully driving action and which ones are not. These campaigns also help to showcase which points along the way are successfully driving action, and which ones are not. This is extremly valuable insight, and it can help you make decisions to optimzie the path to conversion.

### Welcome Nuture Flow

- sign up for an account
- if the developer has created an app, send them one or two more messages
- if not, send them a reminder email after 24 hours, then again after 48 hours, and then if no contact after 120 hours mark them as `INACTIVE`

### Newsletter

> Our newsletters enable us to actively re-engage with our developer audience on a monthly basis, providing updates on our platform and products. We experiement with different layouts, different times of day for send, subject line AB tests, different types of content, and content length, etc. - tweaking and refining the content each month for the most significant impact.

### Best Practices

#### Team Organization

> It is important to have people on your team who have a technical understanding. They don't have to be developers themselves, but they should know what they're talking about and understand what drives thd eveloper community. They need to understand developers' challenges and know how to communicate effectively. For exampple, it's important not to add a lot of "fluff" text when communicating with devlopers. Say what you need to say succinctally, and don't add a huge lead-up with background information. No matter what news your'e sharing with devleopers, make sure you delvier it straight and to the point.

#### Stakeholders

- Who needs to sign off on this?
- Who will your email marketing program impact within your company?

#### Test Your Messaging

- Run a subject line AB test using different phrasing in each and see which one gets more engagement

#### Be Conversational

> We've foudn tehat it's best to keep information short and sweet - be straightforward and informative. Clearly present your information and highlight key benefits. It's best to showcase your information in a problem > solution fashion.

#### Test your layout

#### Test date/time of send

- What day of the week results in the best open rates and engagement?
- What time of day perofrms better?
- Are you sending to different regions in different time zones?

#### Track online and offline interadctions

- For events, send invites to your target audience via your CRM
- Target your audience based on region, product interest / adoption, activity, etc
- Once someone signs up, have an automatic conformation email lined up to send them upon form completion

#### Think globally

- Offer content in other languages / tailored to different regions
- Don't rely on direct translations
- There are many nuances between regions that will need to be taken into account for your audience to hear your authentic voice

#### Bulid Deeper relationships with yoru audience

- through surveys, we were able to get feedback and make our emails more useful
- showing that you are listening is important
- give your audience the mic and absorb their feedback so you can give them what they want
- hear their concerns, their questions, their preferences and use it to provide them with valuable content they're going to enjoy or find useful

#### Understand the full path to conversion

> To understand the journey, it's more than just measuring opens, click-through rates, and link engagement. We also need to understand how devleopers came into our database. Did they fill outa form for an event? Did they visit our website and sign up? Were they on a social cahnnel and came to us that way? It's cruical to measure the full journey and compile this attribution data, overlaid with our findings about messaging/content, formats, subject lines, image style, different calls to action, and more. The more dat you can pull together the beter you can ultimately serve that developer's needs.

## Chapter 3: The Power of Community

- everything has a develoepr service because the apps and devices that brands and software developers are creating become signifantly more valuable when they can share data or service within each other, or can be extended by a developer with a great idea
- by harnessing the creativity of the world-wide developer population, vendors are seeing their products extended and adopted in ways they never thought possible

> Creating a developer service is not enough to declare victory. Unless you have an incredibly differentiated offering, you are often one of the multiple options out there that developers can choose from. This is where community can become such a powerful factor in your success. Develoeprs, by their very nature, are builders who create things that are entirely new. And in the process of creating things that are new, they often use your services in ways that you didn't anticipate and this is wher community comes in. With a vibrant community, you will have develoeprs sharing best practices with each other, helping solve challening problems, and even sharing code to help everyone go faster. When develoeprs see a service with a rich community around it, they are also more confident in adopting it! But community does not happen overnight - it requires focus, investment, nurturing, and patience.

### Introduction

> While communites can form organically, planning can turn your community into a rocket-ship. Communities exist because people grow to be passionate about your product or technology and if you have a thoughtful program for sharing guidelines, tools and templates with developers, you will ampify their efforts in a way that will make the entire community stronger. And championing their success creates a positive feedback loop that inspires others to follow in their footsteps.

- your community does not work for you, they are free to participate and contribute as much or as little as they wish
- it is critical for your community program to be helpful and to focus on their success instead of your own, internal objectives
- community members genuinely care for helping their fellow developers succeed

### Bringing People Together

> Community is fundamentally about people coming together to help each other, and the first step is to create a community that people want to belong to. A big part of that is your product itself, but there are things you can do above and beyond your product to make your community be a place that people wan tot spend time. One of the ways you can do that is through culture.

- by combining our core values, we've seen a culture develop across our community of devleopers that has strengthed our community

#### Developer Groups

- one of the most fundamental components of a successful developer community
- having an in-person support network is invaluable when you are getting started or looking to level-up
  - nothing beats being able to talk to a real human being
- treat them like an extended part of your team and give them what they need to be successful

#### Online Channels

> we live in an increasingly global world and bringing people together via online channels like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, StackExchange or Slack is an excellent way to keep the community humming 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Why so many channels y ou may ask? We've found that developers want to learn in many different ways, so we like to meet them where they are and support organic efforts that spring naturally out of the community

#### Pave the path

> Communites are made up of people. People who have a wide range of skills, goals, and perspectives, and who are participating in the community of their own free will, not for a paycheck. Many of the best contributions I've seen from the community are organic in nature, and are nothing we could have planned, anticipated or event suggested!

- don't be entirely hands-off; provide guidlines, best practices, resources, and templates that can help pave a path towards the outcome that you want
- let your community leaders choose their own content and run their meetings how they want, but you have significantly reduced the effort it takes to run a successful meetup and this will result in more groups, meeting more frequently and with better agendas

#### Grow champions

> When you give people room to follow their passions, they can find amazing solutions to problems you didn't even know you had. When it comes to helping your community feel empowered, you need to do three things:
>
> - make them feel like insiders and part of your family
> - give them the resources they need to succeeed
> - highlight and amplify their success

#### Identifying and inspiring your champions

> How do you identify your potential insiders? They are the people that stand out, for example, they can be your developer group leaders, bloggers in your community, people that have taken the initative to create tools or other open source projects in support of your products, active participants in your developer forums or social channels, vocal advocates at your big accounts or consulting partners, or frequent speakers at your events.

#### Sharing with your champions

> Once you have identified your insiders, whether it's though a formal or informal program, you can start to do a lot more with them. We regularly get their feedback on our products, our developer program, and on our messaging for events. We truly listen to what they have to say
>
> It's generally a best practice to make as many of your resources publicly available as possible -- ideally withoug gating them first. This not only makes it easier for your customers to freely access your resources, but it also aids the growth of your community
>
> When it comes to making developers feel like insiders, you may way to go even further and expose information that you might think of as confidential, for example, early access to your new releases, roadmap plans, and even the opportunity to participate in roadmap development. At this point, you need to decide for yoruself what you are comfortable sharing but it is perfectly reasonable to ask a subset of your community, those you think of as insiders, to sign the same non-disclosure agreements you might put in place with your customers so that you can feel comfortable sharing non-public information with them. This can serve to make them feel even more like they are part of your team -- because they are!

#### Measure Your Success

> I tend to think about the contribution of community in two fundamental ways: awareness and adoption
>
> When it comes to awareness, I've put together marketing operation systems that have looked at how different resources and channels have contributed to deals, wether its new signups that originated from StackExchange, Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook or even referrals where developers tell their friends to check out our product(s).
>
> For adoption, you can ask your community  what is helping them. To get this data, we do focus groups AND surveys on a quarterly basis, since this can be an excellent way to understand the value of different community resources.

- once you figure out what to measure and get executive stakeholder buy-in, measure them fanatically
  - automate your process and measure daily.... if not daily, weekly

Sample Metrics:

- total number of community members and monthly growth
- total developer groups, new groups added, and meeting per month
- visits to our developer center and number of trailhead badges earned
- number of community events per year
- number of social media followers & monthly engagement (likes, retweets, etc)
- NPS Score from quarterly surfaces

#### Conclusion

> The reality is that community builds itself. Your role is to help it grow and shape its path with the programs you put in place to bring peopel together and champion your leaders, the successes you choose to spotlight, and the way you treat the develoeprs that make up your community

## Chapter 4: Starting from Scratch: How to Build a Developer Marketing Program

> To build a developer marketing organization you need buy in from the highest levels of the company possible. If you don't have a champion who is at least a VP, or higher, the time you have to prove your success will be very short. The amount of time that it takes a developer program to be successful from baseline to growth is measured in years, not months or quarters.

### Who are you trying to reach

- correctly identifying what types oof developers you are trying to reach is step 1 in any developer program. There is nothing worse than doing an event and getting the wrong folks in the room.

### Why do you want to reach developers

- getting external folks engaged with your products at a deep enough level to want to code smoething for it is in some circle the holy grail of the their product
- you need to understand why developers would even care about or engage with your tools or products
- there are mnay different types of developers, before you can engage them you need to figure out a few things; also you need to always keep in mind what is in it for them
- without a clear undrstand of what is going to drive developers to your products, your developer program will look like a dying open source project that no one participates in

### Aside: Types of Developers

- **Market-based Develoeprs** -- your company's products are extensible and you want developers to help build out features that some but not all of your customers would use
- **API consumption** -- your product has APIs that allow your products to interact with other products and to programatically accomplish tasks that users would use a GUI for
- **Developer tools** -- closest to traditional marketing practices where the actual product is being bought by developers
- **Developers are needed to use the product** -- anything headless that requires development for adoption, i.e. Twilio

### Support From Above

> Once you ahve identified your target developers and the type of ecosystem you are building, you need to get support from above. Executive buy-in is critical beacuase building a developer ecosystem is a slow process, takinga minimum of 18 months, if not several years, before you are able to show bottom line financial success
>
> Spend the first 3-6 months establishing baseline numbers. If the company has been around for some time, interview power users and sales engineers who are already using your products to learn why and how developers use your tools.
>
> This is key. You need to find developers already using your products. Chances are that you already have them, whether it is the developer team customers or just hobbyists, you need to talk to these people once you have identified them. Find out what they need. And find out where the strengths and weaknesses are currently so you can put them in your backlog and address them.

### What does your team need to succeed

- developer marketing is different at every company but your priorities will have an impact on how you hire and what roles you hire

> Another important role for this team is a community manager, marketing specialist or marketing manager, this person will focus on social media, newsletter creation, analytics and metrics collection, logistics and many of the standard functions of a marketing team that are found in any type of marketing organization. Again as your team is just starting out, you might be doing all of this but as your success grows, bringing this person on board can expand your reach and get you out of the tactical and into the strategy which is where you should be all the time as team leader

### Creating your developer portal

- Searchable API Reference documentation
- Developer blog - your blog should not be focused on marketing but on using and experimenting with your products
- Getting Started - there should be a great big button that leads to a page with all the current information needed to get people up and running quickly, ideally within ten minutes or less
- Labs or tutorials - while onboarding is the primary goals of developer marketing, having great tutorials on how to use different areas of your APIs, or other products, is vital
- Contact system -- you need some place for developers to reach out for help and give you feedback on things on the site, such as forums or a Slack channel
- Code samples (optional) -- having a source controlled set of code samples and examples of the top 10 user cases for your API in your most common languages helps lots of folks solve their problem quickly
- Community forums (optional) -- building a community is hard, you need a place where the crowd can hang out and discuss things, these should be moderated and monitored
- Event page (optional) -- let people know where you are going to be next
- Social media list (optional) -- learn where your community is, are they are on Twitter? Reddit? StackOverflow? Find out and go participate when them

#### Content Management System

- make sure you have a CMS behind your portal
- talk to your web development team and work with them
- look to adopt company and industry standards rather than going and building your own
- thess less you need to build and maintain, the more you can be focused on reaching your developers

### Launch your first event

- in your first event, I highly recommend a hands-on lab for 15-20 people and see what their feedback is

### Learnings

- don't be tempated to showcase the new and shiny when it is not relevant to your audience's day to day yet
- developers are a trailing indicator, in most cases, you are better off teaching them how to use the products they own already, rather than something that isn't relevant
- add fricition to the registration process, we want people want to be there
- format of keynote, panels, and labs works well for most community events
  - for a marketplace-based ecosystem replacing the labs with a hackthon might be a better option
  - key is to give people who work with the product time with people who make the product

## Chapter 5: Structuring Developer Relations

### What is the definition of developer relations

> The answer depends on the organization that asks the question, but one aspect is common developers interact with products beyond their initial scope and build their own solutions. The ability to extend a product is what makes the difference between regular support, marketing or engineering groups on one hand and devloper relations departments on the other. The moment developers start co-creating, they are not only customers but become participants and other partners, who are critical to the organization's success.
>
> In such two sided markets, developers are occassionally in the role of the customer and are marketed to, but more frequently it is not the marketing and potential sales that provides the scale. Instead the providers need to offer the correct incentives and enabling technologies. Those providing the technology often depend on devleopers to provide feedback, use available resources and cooperate. What's more, developers are a creative force that make or break technology products, and it is a strategic imperative for a provider to understand the requirements and trends that emerge.
>
> Marketing is ultimately about products and about positioning those twoards a customer base. But in order to collaborate with a community ov volunteers and to co-create technology with them, the scope becomes much borader than this. After all, many tools, content pieces or activities in developer relations do not sell anything and sometimes it isn't even about products but about entire technology strands. Futhermore, often developer relations creates tools that benefit the ecosystem, and with it maybe even competitors, knowing that developers expect a degree of flexability  and connectivity.
>
> Developer relations is about bridging between heterogeneous developer communities and technology engineering inside the actual company and is the interface that allows for true collaboration.

### Developer Communities in a nuthsell

> It is precisely this learning experience that drives literally every developer community out there. It starts with fascination, then evolves into a growing appetite for knowledge, but the final ingredient is always the fun of solving problems together and the joy of shared learning.
>
> If you structure a developer relations department, these communities are your most important resource, partner and audience. There are two parameters that govern how you're likely to interact with them: the accessability of your company's technology and your business priority.
>
> Here we have a crucial difference between **developer marketing** and **developer relations**. The former creates a channel and tries to send information that hopefully leads to action to a defined audience. Developer relations, on the other hand; is about creating and growing social groups and their relationship with your business. And these groups are not bound by the events they show up at. They share an interest and a passion.

- all communities share a passion for learning and teaching

### Sharing the workload -- roles and responsibilities

- Developer advovcates are normally engineers working part time or maybe even full tiem with external developer communities. Speaking at events, creating demonstrations, writing documentation or acticles are all tasks that fall into this role's typical profile
- Developer relations program manager will help you scale by supporting
- internal partnerships are critical betcause developer relations is often the main interface to the developer audience. They may be responsible for a variety of tasks:
  - event organization
  - documentation (including smaple code)
  - content creation (e.g. videos, walk-throughs, codelabs)
  - representation (in events, in PR settings, in media, as social media contact)
  - Tech support
  - tech consulting
  - relationship management
  - engineering of bridge technologies (e.g. SDKs, toolkits)
- developer relations departments typically start with a single engineer, followed by a "band of two" before they turn into a functional structure. Then a matrix is very common.
- DevRel:
  - supports communities of learning and pratice
  - participates in the developer ecosystem
  - grows the  cake by supporting the larger developer ecosystem

> DevRel tasks tend to be long-term engagements and are on the surface contradicting the typical business requirement of shrot-term ROIs. W're talking essentially about relationship work and truth is the currency developer relations deals in.

### Relationships at Scale

> Tried and tested tools of marketing allow you to segment and understand your customers; also helps you identify motivations, segmentation and needs of your developer audience. Before you think about building or changing your developer relations team, understand their audience first. This effort start of course with the developers but it should also include parties that work with your audience as well, like partner organizations, competitions, service offerings, trainers, event organizers, etc.

- if you're only planning to reach developers but do not consider a way for them to channel their feedback, then you're considering only half of the equation
- types of interactions:
  - 1:few
  - 1:many
  - 1:few:many (have people teach for you)

#### 1:few:many programs

- Communities
- Influencers -- Every technology space has its recognized exeprts and opinion leaders. You want to work with them, you want to listen to their feedback and keep them on your side! While this may feel like a 1:few approach at first, it is important to recognize that these experts themselves reach many developers, often thousands, through articles, social media, PR work, and so on.
- Partners

### DevRel Organization Models

#### Product-centric

- cloud team
- backend team
- database team

### Location

> Developer relationships is about **relationships** and relationships are built one way and one way only: through multiple in-person encounters that are used to build mutual trust. How do we build trust? By keeping promises and by staying in the game long term, not only just for the duration of the short transaction. So in other worlds, we'll need to bump into each other from time to time, have fun during those encounters, and we should all have skin in the game
>
> When you build a developer relations team, location should therefore be an important consideration. Your advocates and your local community managers benefits a lot from shared cultural contexts and local networks.

### Conclusion

How to thoughtfully approach the tsk to form a successful relations team that can serve all your needs and grow your ecosystem:

1. Decide your product strategy
1. Map your ecosystem
1. Now you should be able to idnetify a handful of programs and their nature: 1:few, 1:many, 1:few:many
1. If your team is large enough, consider your local presence as an laternative to a large centralized team
1. Now structure your teams. You ahve four general ways to distribute work (functional, audience-centric, product-centric, execution-centric) but it is always a compromise between efficiency and agility and between external focus and internal alignment
1. Your developer relations department is neither marketing nor sales, so don't consider outreach or adoption as the main metrics

## Chapter 6: Repositioning Your Brand To Developers

> a small core team of individuals are best equipped to define the direction of ongoing developer engagement, and to make rapid decisions to ensure that the engagements are successful

### Strategy for Developer Engagement

- Significant online content
- In-person engagement
- Quality free education
- An external champions community
- A program to engage developers at startups

### Ongoing online engagement

- we started sending out a monthly developer newsletter to stay in touch with the community on an ongoing basis
- make it easy to find a community of like-minded develoeprs with forums for questions and discussions. The whole industry has seen that the success of communiites like Stack Overflow shows the best, most trusted experts are the developer's peers who have solved the exact same problem
- newsletters can add value, but only if they are true newsletters with technical content and links to new material. Faux newsletters that are nothing more than marketing pitches will not only fail, but can also backfire and leave a bad impression

### Events

- Sales and Field Marketing teams have to change their mindsets to not just invest in programs that generate immediate pipeline
  - this required explaining that realizing the benefits of developer-focused programs requires patience
  - unlikely to pay off in deals closed this quarter, or even next quarter, for developres who have never engaged with the company before
- developers don't want slick marketing collateral; they want code that works
- developers attend in-person and online events because they are curious
  - curious about meeting Oracle people, about learning about a giant company, about cutting-edge tech like AI and blockchain, about cloud services that might advacne their business or career
  - they come to learn, not to buy or be aggressively marketed at

### Overall Learning and Best Practices

- relentlessly listen to developers both inside and outside the ecosystem, and inside and outside the company itself, to get the best view on your evolving audience
  - what developers want is constantly changing
  - engagement must always grow and evolve to meet developer's needs
- understand that developers don't like to be sold to, and need to be engaged, not pitched. Anything that's purely a marketing effort will fail
- get executive buy-in and support for developer engagement, from the highest level
- define a small core team (handful or less) that defines direction, incorporates input, and makes fast decisions, and most of all,  isn't afriad to make changes in mid-stream
- engage online and in person. The key is back-and-forth engagement and continuous education -- not presenting one-way marketing messages
- think big and execute in small increments showing some value in each increment
- a lot of small activities can be more effective for reaching diverse audiences, as well as allowing for paid changes and iterative learning
- always remember to be authentic, open, and honest in your developer engagement

## Chapter 7: Connecting Developers with Experts

> When software developers using your platform or tools need answers or advice, you might think that your company would be able to provide the perfect resources for them. And you would be partially correct. While developers do seek guidance from their vendors, they often prefer to get information from their peers, meaning from your community, particularly from external developer experts within it

- as much as I know about development, I know there are experts who know more. Most developers recognize this truth, and while the very best may come to a community or expert group in hopes of spreading their knowledge (and building their reputations), they realize that these outlets can also teach them and make them more successful

### How to build a network of experts

- your network should be a good mix of internal and external developer experts, ranging from specialists to generalists, who act as educators and role models. They are positive representative for your company and brand, but they aren't just cheerleaders. They're professionals who can teach and influence developers wh oare using your software. Morever, they're professionals whom the developers will actrively seek out for input and collaboration. Providing access to these experts will be seen as a valuable service to cmmunity members. It's also valuable to the company providing the community, as members can provide real-time feedback about the company's products in terms of what works and what doesn't
- you must build something that gives a reason for developer experts to come. And participate. And stay. And return.

### Finding experts within your company

> One group will consistent of **Developer Evangelists** who are most likely to sit directly within your developer relations team. They are often (if not always) developers themserlves, and they possess first-hand experience with the broad range of solutions that outside developers use. Given their direct experience with diverse solutions, these evangelists can speak knowledgeably to developers about a variety of technical topics
>
> The second group comprises **Product Experts**. They are more specialized, yet still gifted at relating to develoeprs. Internally, they are your product managers and product engineers. Their contirbutions come from their deep know-how in their product areas; offering up information and insights to developers who focus on their products.

### A developer program builds your exeternal network

- you'll spot external experts speaking at events, participating in other communities, and generally establishing themselves as professionals who are knowledgeable about your technology
- this is where your developer program comes into play. A program for evangelists, product managers, and other highly skilled and motivated develoerps - like a broader developer community - is a method for providing expert access
- to break things down even further, our developer program concentrates heavily on three areas: awareness, engagement, and adoption
- awareness, as the name implies, makes developers aware of products. Engagement educates developers more deeply about these offerings. Adoption includes tools and content that developers require to build and implement solutions
- to encourage external experts to join your developer program, you should have a strong online presence, for example on social media. Use it to make a positive impression and highlight your community and your developer program. For example, in the online community, look for new members who have written their first bllog post or have taken a stab at answering questions. Encourage them. Give them positive reinforcement. You could promote their post through your social channels and within the community itself.
- you want to be on the lookout for future talent too. No expert - even popular ones - started as an expert

### The developer community

- to help maintain order, we have established rules of engagement and moderation guidelines for our community site. On top of that, our seasoned members may kindly call out simple questions from new visitors (ones the rookies might have been able to answer themselves via a basic search).
- the term `community` is actually an umbrella for smaller groups who are devoted to one or some of the topics within the community, not to the entire community itself. We discovered the layout logic of this strategy early on by building spaces that served as sub-communities, and approach taht eventually evolved into tagging content and topic areas.
- most developers come to the community because they're stuck and they need questions answered quickly
- with the right automated tools, you can easily identify experts in specific fields and connect peopel more quickly to the content that might apply best to them

## Chapter 8: "Build It and They Will Come" May Not Work Investing Early in Developer Success

> While developer marketing and developer relations are usually not part of a profit and loss calculation, the success of our commun iites often ties to revenue somewhere else in the company

### The Journey

- it pays to engage all types of developers, and in order to attract and retain smaller partners, indie develpoers, and even students, you ahve to show how your program helps them find success

### Beyond Awards: Improving Sales

- we looked for patterns as to which of their content did better than others, how strong the app/content descriptions were, the quality of the screenshots, and any reviews that existed. We also explored  how their content performed in different markets compared to the US
- based on our analysis, we provided developers with feedback over email and phone consultations on how we thought they could grow their busienss. We advised on how to improve their screenshots. We helped people rewrite their content descriptions, which can make a big difference from those who don't speak English as a native lanugage

### Pilot Programs

- if you've been around developer relations long enough, you're probably familiar with the TTHW metric (which stands for 'time to hello world'). This is the amount of time it takes a brand new developer to get strated with your platform/API/SD and achieve the equivalent of `printf("Hello World!\n")`. We asked our third-party developers to focus on TTROI ("time to ROI") instead. How long did it take a small business to see real ROI after clicking on the "Get App Now" button in the app store?
- to help develoeprs u nderstand and address these priorities of small businesses, we posted best practices in a series of blog posts, including tips in our monthly newsletter, and delivered advice at our regional QuickBooks Conenct conferences. For some of our top performing applications, we performed 1:1 consultants to give specific advice. We looked for apps that were already gaining some amount of traction with our customers and asked what we could do to help them be even more successful

### Best Practices

- you may need to take different steps to help your developers be successful
- you need to understand what motivates them
  - how do they define ROI? Revenue? Recognition? Learning new skills? Minimizing technical network?
- don't just listen to your top partners
  - call your top indie developers; find out what is working for them and what isn't
  - personal connection leads to higher satisfaction for both your external developers and your employees
  - use the feedback you get to change what your program offers and how other teams within your company oepration
  - if developers aren't seeing ROI, they'l leave your ecosystem
  - if they leave, your company loses out on future revenue and on cusomter satisfaction
- find developers that are seeing quick wins on your platform and caoch them achieve even more
  - then find ways to turn that 1:1 coaching into scabable tools and programs that can reach your entire ecosystem
- one you figure out what works for your company, share it!
  - it will take some trial and error, but once you learn how you can hep your developer community find success, tell that story
  - show your community that you don't have to be a top 100 brand to succeed on your platform
  - you aren't the only developer advocates for your platform, those you make successful will be even stronger advocates
