## Introduction: Developers Are a Big Deal. Marketing to Them Shouldn't Be

- If you, or your team, work in *developer relations*, your responsibility is to build credibility, trust, and influence. You will find yourself evangelising for your company by representing it at events, blogging and on social media, typically taking the role of a community manager. You will likely have the technical chops to write sample code and run demos. Developer relations is also about advocating for the external developers you encounter, representing them by giving their feedback to your technical teams to influence their product roadmap and strategy, and inputting defect reports and feature requests. Your role is a balance between representing the needs of external developers and evangelising your company's product
- If you work in *developer marketing*, your role is to encourage third- party devleoeprs to learn about, try, adopt, use, and even contribute to a software product. To be credible in front of a developer audience, you need to be able to communicate about your product at a detailed level without unnecessary marketing jargon or BS. This probably means having a technical background or at lest sufficient experience in your domain to ensure you are taken seriously. Activitivies you would expect to be engaged in include creating the developer marketing strategy segementation of developers into personas, organizing social media, content marketing and email campagins, planning events and conferences, and steering developer rewards programs, developer advocacy programs, and innovator funding/incubator programs.
- *developer product engineering* will build and deliver an SDK or API to third-party defvelopers. You will be responsible for the strategy, roadmpa, and development of the tools and code needed in the SDK, and the technical content surrounding it, such as sample code and technical documentation. In the developer product engineering team, you will need the skills to provide answers in technical forums, write blog posts, and create content for webinars, video tutorials and trainig courses. And, if you are ain devloper marketing or devloper relations, members of this team will be your go-to folks
- Developers are particularly averse to generic, aggressive or reptitive messaging about tools, products, and services. Instead they want relevant and meaningful information and the opportunity to make up their own minds.
- This book isn't a step-by-step guide to writing a developer marketing strategy, but instead a toolbox for you to gain the knowledge and practical undrestanding needed to work with your audience



## Using Developer Personas to Stay Customer-Obsessed

- need to define what you want to achieve and what success looks like to keep your team aligned
- as products are built and brought to market, they should also carry a means of measuring success
- the team needs a shared definition of where they are going and how they know when they have been successful
- our developer personas became core team assets and a variable in our business planning - we structured our offfers and programs based on the business and life goals of each persona, we included them in our marketing agency briefs, and we even based our competitive analysis on the personas
- magic of personas is that they provide a composite view of a larger audience, and they allow you to make that audience a part of your product's narrative
- developer personas provide an easy way for non-develoeprs to understand this audience

### What is a Developer Persona?

> Wikipedia describes a persona as "a fictional character crated to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way... a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users... They are captured in 1-2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a relastic character

#### Examples

- "Mort", the ooportunistic developer, likes to create quick-working solutions for immediate problems and focuses on productivity and learn as needed
- "Elvis", the pragmatic programmer, likes to create long-lasting solutions addressing the problem domain, and learn while working on the solution
- "Einstein", the paranoid programmer, likes to create the most efficient solution to a given problem, and typically learn in advance before working on the solution

### Personas vs Market Segments

- the use of market segments is most handy on the business-oriented side of the house because they're easy to build marketing programs upon. You can cleanly size an opportunity, you can build a lookalike audience pretty simply, and you can measure the ROI of your campaign using easily observable audience attributes
- the idea of a market segmenet is similar to a persona -- market segmentation tends to be a qunatitative or data-drive process . -- user personas tend to be a qualitative process, using internal personal drivers and motivations
- Personas for product and campaign creation
  - tend to focus on the needs of your audience, what drives their adoption and usage of your offering
- Market segmentation for execution and measuring the success of what you take to market
  - rely on observable characteristics of your audience -- where they are and what they do
- find a way to map personas to segements

### Characteristics of a Persona

- Basic Demographics -- to make this person real, give them a name and create a composite of who they are using what you already know about your target developer audience, perhaps anchoring on someone you met at a recent event that you think well reprsents your user base
  - Age? Where do they live? Where do they work?
- Customer Journey
  - How does the developer's world interface with your product or platform?
  - What does their journey gernally look like as they move through tie world, and as they make contact with yours

- once you have your basic character story written out, then you're ready to flesh it out with market trend data and facts
  - Use survey data and syndicated research that summarizes larger market trends around my audience
- use insights around the customer journey and adoption decisions to build a marketing plan around each audience

- messaging framework should be tailored to each of the personas
